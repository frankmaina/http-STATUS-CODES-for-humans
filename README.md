# http-STATUS-CODES-for-humans(README NOT COMPLETE)

A small project that popped up when I needed to access a popular browser based MMO but could not seem
to get any response. At first i thought it was something to do with my browser cache, so i decided to 
write a short script to fetch the webite via get and validate its response. History cut short, I decided to 
open source the script.

## Installation


```installation
git clone https://github.com/frankmaina/http-STATUS-CODES-for-humans.git
```

### Running

```running
cd http-STATUS-CODES-for-humans
nodejs index.js {URL} e.g.
nodejs index.js https://github.com

```

### Optional -O

You can have the script redirect you to a website with further explanation on the status code by simply adding " -O " after the {URL} arguement.

### TO COME
* Specific search functionality
* different types of http calls
* native GUI(windows first)
