# http-STATUS-CODES-for-humans(README NOT COMPLETE)

A small project that popped up when i needed to access a popular browser based MMO but could not seem
to get any ersponse. At first io thought it was something to do with my browser, so i decided to 
write a short svript to fetch the webite via get and validate its response. History cut shor, I decided to 
open source the script/
